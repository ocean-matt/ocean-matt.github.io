			<p class="card-text">When I'm not at my computer doing my research, there's nothing I like more than getting out and about on foot. Preferably somewhere away from civilisation!
			I have always had a strong interest in walking, spurred on by numerous walks and holidays with the family in my childhood.
			My coastal holidays and walks in Norfolk, Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in particular helped to develop my fascination and interest in the oceans. </p>
			<p class="card-text">During my undergraduate degree, I spent 3 years on the committee of Southampton University Hillwalking Club (SUHC). 
			From 2014 - 16, I was Day Walk Secretary. This involved creating and leading a day-long walk each Saturday.
			I became President of the Club in 2016.
			As President, I sought to improve the Club's previously cumbersome and outdated communication with it's members. 
			I improved the Club's social media presence, creating the current Facebook page which is still in use today with over 1500 followers.
			I also successfully applied for Student Union funding for 4 high-end PMR-446 licence-free two-way radios to improve communication between Committee members and walk leaders when managing larger groups.
			This was a particulary important purchace, since many of our walk locations have little to no mobile signal.</p>
			<p class="card-text">I continue to be a very active member in SUHC. As a former Committee member, I often help out as a "Competent Walk Leader" for some of the larger Club activites. 
			During the COVID pandemic, I have been working with the current Vice President (Will) to maintain and update the Club's website.</p>

			<h2 class="card-title">Photography</h2>
			<p class="card-text">I am a completely self-taught amateur photographer, specialising in landscape and wildlife shots. 
			I do this purely for my pleasure although I may consider selling photos in the future (maybe when I'm a better photographer :P). 
			As you might imagine, many of my photos come from when I'm out and about on walks.
