			<h2 class="card-title">My PhD Research</h2>
			<h4 class="subtitle">Project title: Changing Atlantic influences on northwest European shelf seas</h4>
			<p class="card-text">My current research focuses on the changing North Atlantic Ocean and its effects within European shelf seas. 
			Using model outputs and observational datasets, I will analyse how the shelf seas are driven by basin-scale change over different timescales. 
			There will be a strong emphasis on quantifying changes in temperature and salinity structure in the North Sea. 
			I am excited to be taking an interdisciplinary approach to this: I am interested in how both physical and chemical changes to the water structure alter shelf sea ecosystems and productivity. 
			I will also be using measurements of plankton biomass from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey to assess any possible relationships.</p>
			<p class="card-text">My PhD research follows on from my MSci final year research project, which quantified a cold temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre and its effects on transport towards and along the European shelf edge.</p>
			<p class="card-text">I am supervised by Prof. Bob Marsh (University of Southampton), Dr. James Harle (National Oceanography Centre) and Prof. Martin Edwards (Marine Biological Association/CPR Survey).</p>

			<h2 class="card-title">Public Scientific Outreach</h2>
			<ul> <!-- unordered list start -->
				<li> I have started <a href="blog_posts/index.html">a blog</a>! New and exciting content will be published from time to time. Keep an eye on my <a href="https://twitter.com/Ocean_MattC">Twitter account</a> for notifications of new posts and do let me know what you think!</li>
				
				<li> I was involved in a project to <a href="https://noc.ac.uk/facilities/ships/rrs-james-cook/rrs-james-cook-virtual-tour">3D scan the RRS James Cook for use in a virtual tour</a>. The scans were published on the NOC website and will be used in future open days and other outreach activities.</li>
				
				<li> I wrote <a href="blog_posts/2020_06_16_post.html">Challenger Wave newsletter June 2020 SALTS article ("The Last Ship")</a> about my time at sea on the RAPID-AMOC cruise in March 2020. This was written in collaboration with Fraser Goldsworth, University of Oxford DTP student.</li>
				
				<li> I was due to start working with the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/discoveroceanography/index.page">Discover Oceanography</a> team on board the University of Southampton vessel RV Callista. 
				Disover Oceanography is a hands-on activity-led day out on Southampton Water, aimed at school and college students to get them engaged in marine science. This has sadly been postponed until COVID restrictions allow.</li>

			<h2 class="card-title">Teaching & Demonstrating</h2>
			<p class="card-text">As well as doing my research, I am a postgraduate demonstrator (essentially a teaching assistant) for several undergraduate modules in the School of Ocean and Earth Science at the University:</p>
			<ul> <!-- unordered list start -->
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes1004.page">SOES1004:</a> Physics Of The Ocean (<i>formerly Physical Oceanography 1</i>). I demonstrate some boatwork techniques on board RV Callisa. As this is a first year module, this is often students' first time on a research vessel.</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes1013.page">SOES1013:</a> Key Skills for Marine Scientists. I have led a Meteorology fieldcourse component, which focusses on marine meteorological observations and forecasts.</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes2010.page">SOES2010:</a> The Dynamic Ocean (<i>formerly Physical Oceanography 2</i>). Assisting with boatwork & Matlab tutorials.</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes3010.page">SOES3010:</a> Large Scale Ocean Processes & Climate. Matlab tutorials.</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes6014.page">SOES6014:</a> Introduction to Physical Oceanography. I assist with a basic calculation tutorial for new MSc students.</li>
				<li> <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/soes6018.page">SOES6018:</a> MSc Key Skills and Literature Review. I show the Masters students how to use the CTD and ADCP systems on board RV Callista.</li>
			</ul> <!-- end of list -->
			<p> In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching and demonstrating has, for the most part, moved to online platforms for the 2020-21 academic year. I have however still been demonstrating for some COVID-secure boatwork sessions on RV Callisa.</p>

			<h2 class="card-title">Sea-going research experience: RAPID cruise, March 2020</h2>
			<p class="card-text">
			My PhD research does not include any fieldwork, and what fieldwork I have done previously as part of my MSci was on board the University vessel RV Callista for only a few hours at a time. 
			So in March 2020, I volunteered as a core science team member on the <a href="https://www.rapid.ac.uk">RAPID Cruise </a>to get valuable insight and practical experience of observational oceanography at sea.
			My scientific roles included:
			<ul> <!-- unordered list start -->
				<li> Taking 2-hourly meteorolgical observations.</li>
				<li> Taking 4-hourly seawater samples for salinometer analysis.</li>
				<li> Assisting with the deployment and recovery of oceanographic moorings (see video below).</li>
				<li> Daily processing of bathymetry, navigation and underway sampling data, using some Matlab scripts and programs.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
