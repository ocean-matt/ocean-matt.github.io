			<h2 class="card-title">My PhD Research</h2>
			<h4 class="subtitle">Project title: Changing Atlantic influences on northwest European shelf seas</h4>
			<p class="card-text">My PhD research focussed on the changing North Atlantic Ocean and its effects within European shelf seas. 
			Using model outputs and observational datasets, I analysed how the shelf seas are driven by basin-scale change over different timescales. 
			There was a strong emphasis on quantifying changes in temperature and salinity structure in the North Sea. 
			I was excited to be taking an interdisciplinary approach to this: I am interested in how both physical and chemical changes to the water structure alter shelf sea ecosystems and productivity. 
			<p class="card-text">My PhD research follows on from my MSci final year research project, which quantified a cold temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre and its effects on transport towards and along the European shelf edge.</p>
			<p class="card-text">I am supervised by Prof. Robert (Bob) Marsh (University of Southampton) and Dr. James Harle (National Oceanography Centre).</p>

			<h2 class="card-title">Sea-going research experience: RAPID cruise, March 2020</h2>
			<p class="card-text">
			My PhD research did not include any fieldwork, and what fieldwork I have done previously as part of my MSci was on board the University vessel RV Callista for only a few hours at a time. 
			So in March 2020, I volunteered as a core science team member on the <a href="https://www.rapid.ac.uk">RAPID Cruise </a>to get valuable insight and practical experience of observational oceanography at sea.
			My scientific roles included:
			<ul> <!-- unordered list start -->
				<li> Taking 2-hourly meteorolgical observations.</li>
				<li> Taking 4-hourly seawater samples for salinometer analysis.</li>
				<li> Assisting with the deployment and recovery of oceanographic moorings (see video below).</li>
				<li> Daily processing of bathymetry, navigation and underway sampling data, using some Matlab scripts and programs.</li>
			</ul>

			For a detaled summary of life at sea on the RAPID cruise was like, please read my <a href="blog_posts/2020_06_16_post.html">Challenger Wave article "The Last Ship"</a> 
			and blog post <a href="blog_posts/2020_06_06_post.html">"Moorings: The workhorse of the RAPID project"</a> which summarises the key components of the moorings we were servicing.
