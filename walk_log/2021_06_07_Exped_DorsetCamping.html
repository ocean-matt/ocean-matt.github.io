				<h5>Sat 5th June: Corfe Castle walk.</h5>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				We boarded the 09:00 train from Southampton Central to Wareham, Dorset. It was a busy train, pretty much pre-Covid levels of people. Our campers, along with a few day trippers, took this train. Our camping luggage travelled down separately in the cars of some kind members. 
				Once everyone was at Wareham, we split into two groups of approximately 15 for the walk ahead: Group 1 led by Will and I, Group 2 led by James and Tom D. It was great to see so many new people, as well as former Committee and Alumni who had made the journey especially for us (Serena, Shaun, Eilish and Teo)!
				We set off southwards towards Corfe Castle. Along the route, Thomas tested his "MSR Guardian Purifier" pump in some very questionable red/green water, tasting the water and commenting as if it was a fine wine sample.
				My hiking pole, attached to my rucksac, snagged on an overhanging branch, causing the securing loop to rip off my bag. Will decided to rekindle his shampoo advert modelling. A further 15 minutes of walking saw us arrive in Corfe Castle village, our lunch destination.
				</p>

				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Serena, Jenny, Thomas and I used our National Trust membership to explore the castle itself, and had lunch at the summit overlooking the heritage steam railway.
				Thomas and Jenny had brought some form of sausage casserole in a flask which took much shaking and poking to get out, much to the delight of Serena and I. After eating our lunch we time the perfect 4-past-president selfie with the steam train in the background.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				After the lunch break, we headed west, over a steep hill (yes, Ben ran up it!) onto the Knowle Hill ridge. The views across Corfe, Poole Harbour and the Isle of Wight (you could clearly see The Needles) were incredible.
				Shaun posted on the trig point before we headed downhill through a field of cows with calfs. After calmnly avoiding the cows, including some on the wrong side of the fence, we made it to a country lane with some rather conflicting signs.
				Crossing the heritage railway towards Wareham, our walk became pretty uneventful with the exception of large herds of fallow deer.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				On reaching Wareham, we did a brief Sainsburys supply run for the following day, before getting some fish and chips for dinner and eating them by the river. Day trippers were directed back to Wareham train station, and Shaun kindly gave me a lift to the campsite (a couple of kms south of Moreton).
				Along the way, we found a lost-looking Byron who had cycled from Southampton. We alerted him to our presence but Shaun's speedy driving soon ment Byron lost track of us. After our own navigational blip, we worked our way down the long gravel track to the campsite.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				The campsite was a pretty basic affair: a clearing in the middle of the trees and rhododendrons. No electricity or running water (with the exception of a single standpipe in the car park). A bucket shower (bravely used by Jenny and Thomas) and a composting toilet (strictly for "solid waste" only) were the only facilities.
				Fortunately, there was a fire pit provided, which was quickly stoked and lit with the help of some highly flammable hand sanitiser! This provided the social centre for the evening - chatting rubbish as always, sharing cider and beer and enjoying "Will's uncomfortable stump" (Byron quote).
				</p>
				
				<br><h5>Sun 6th: Bere Regis walk.</h5>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				The campers slowly got up one by one. Breakfast was a DIY job. We didn't leave the campsite will nearly 11, and even by that stage some were still in their tents! The walk was from the campsite itself: walking northeast to Bere Regis and many villages with "puddle" in their name.
				It was a rather overcast day compared to the bright sun of the Saturday. Our lunch location was a obelisk buried in dense tree growth at the top of Black Hill. A geocache consisting of a small notebook was hidden behind a loose brick.
				Matthew D made sure to log our arrival. The walk was mostly flat and uneventful. We did have great fun on a rope swing in a patch of woodland. We passed through a village which felt like it was straight out of Hot Fuzz: 
				Briantspuddle, proudly displaying it's "Best Small Village" awards from Dorset County Council. Shaun got very sunburned (even more than me, which is always a suprise!).
				We arrived back at the campsite for around 17:00 and once again got the fire going. The wood had become damper after some light morning drizzle, so look a lot more effort to light than the previous night.
				</p>

				<p class="blogpost_body">Dinner was a fire-baked potato starter, with a soya mince chili main (slightly better than Mahmoud's soya bolognese from Evasion, but it's still the unappealing slop that sadly soya mince always is).
				Evening entertainment was yet more campfire gossip - yes, we never stop in this Club! New member Dr Will F also brought Tesco catepillar cake for his own birthday, and a cake sparkler was provided by fellow medecine student Kate.
				Meanwhile, Will H and I shared a bottle of Fireball: neat, not mixed. I later learned that Jenny thought this made us hyper. On the contray, it seemed to make me sleep better! Bed was around 23:00.
				</p>
				
				<br><h5>Mon 7th: heading for home (and Dorchester walk for those who were free).</h5>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				We got up much faster than Sunday, mainly as we had to pack up the tents and yurt and leave by 11:00. Sadly, due to work, I was unable to attend the Dorchester walk. Kate kindly drove myself, Laural and Dorcas to Moreton Station to get back to Southampton.
				1h 20m later, I was back in the bustling metropolis of Southampton.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				All in all, a thoroughly enjoyably weekend and much-needed break from my work! Thanks to organiser Thomas and all attendees for making it a great trip. For my full load of photos, please see this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kYLrt5GCj3rXUGMa7">Google Photos album</a>.
