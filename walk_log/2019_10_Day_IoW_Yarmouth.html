				First things first, I was summoned to help lead this due to a large expected turnout. The forecast was for rain all day, with a Met Office yellow or amber warning in force.
				I did try persuading the day walk secs to call it off, to no avail. So here I was, stuck with going on a very wet walk. How bad could it really be?! 
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Our outbound journey went as smoothly as possible, no delays on the trains or ferry. So far so good. After our half-hour ferry crossing from Lymington to Yarmouth, we disembarked to a land awash with water.
				Our route pretty much followed the Club's traditional route: Yarmouth -> Needles (although we cut the corner off) -> Tennyson Down - Freshwater Bay -> Yarmouth. 
				It took just an hour for people to begin dropping out: we left 4 people at the nearest bus stop to make their way back. The Day Walk Secs' resolve was not broken, and vowed to continue with the walk.
				On reaching the Headon Warren for lunch, we had a further spate of drop outs (sensible people!!). We were already cold and wet. Did we turn back ourselves? No! Big mistake...
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Choosing not to go all the way to the Needles and Old Battery, we headed straight for Tennyson Down, the rain ever falling. Morale was dwindling. No views were to be seen. Would this ever end? 
				The rain certainly didn't - it persisted all day long. On arrival back to Yarmouth, we dashed for the first ferry back. Sadly this ferry did not have it's heating on so we sat together huddling for warmth, using an emergency shelter (which I fortunately brought with me!) as a blanket.
				It was also at this stage that I realised my coat + trousers had breached: I barely had a dry patch of clothing.
				The post-ferry train certainly wasn't much warmer than the ferry, but at least it was the quick service. On arrival back to Southampton, I was so cold and wet (and late) that I couldn't be bothered waiting for the next bus, so a few of us shared a taxi back to our accomodation.
				So was the walk worth it? No, not at all. It's certainly made me into a more "fair weather" walker too!!
