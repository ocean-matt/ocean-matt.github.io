				It took 3 trains to get there, but finally we arrived in the village of Mortimer to begin this week's walk. 
				After Will's customary introduction, we headed south-west, parrallel to the railway.
				The route featured several curious cows, sunbathing sheep and many a selfie taker!
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				We had many a nagivational trip-up along the way, no fault of Will or any other Committee member: rather it was the fact that most paths were so overgrown, we kept missing them!
				This was especially apparent when we found ourselves in a field full of long grass, surrounded by barbed wire fences - and we all know, you don't want to touch those!
				The few stiles dotted around were also falling apart, thus rating very badly on our unofficial "Stiles with Style" rankings. Our lunch spot was "Kiln Pool", where we were acosted by many hungry ducks.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				After lunch, we headed for the ruined Roman town of Silchester: now little more visibly survives than the outer walls. Tom D was in his element, providing a free history lesson.
				Following the settlement's wall, we arrived at the ampitheatre.
				Tom and Cherish had a "battle to the death", umpired by our very own martial arts master Ben. Will and I recreated that famous Harry Bourne pose from 2019's edition of the walk.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				After the gladiator combat, we continued around the wall, past some very curious llamas. Walking though some woodland parallel to the walls, we almost missed our next path yet again (due to thick undergrowth).
				We headed south towards our destination of Bramley. Going through fields of soft wheat and rye, Ellie was nearly consumed by their sheer height.
				</p>
				
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				On arrival at Bramley, we sat at the "Bramley Inn" pub: clearly under new management since our last visit.
				This proved to be a bad thing. A terrible cider selection and a rather overpriced bottle of Magners (at Â£4.50!!). Most downed their drinks in minutes before rushing to catch the 17:55 train.
				Will and I decided to quietly enjoy our expensive bevarages - well, that was until the pub started blasting questionable "music" over the outdoor speakers.
				We left for the 18:55 train back to Southampton. Despite the navigational blips, it was an enjoyable day's walk!
				</p>
