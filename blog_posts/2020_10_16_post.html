				On the 28th March, I stepped back on dry land after 3 weeks at sea. The research cruise had been cut short due to the worsening global COVID-19 situation. The UK Lockdown had officially started on the 23rd; less than a week before our arrival. 
				Although we had internet access whilst at sea and we knew what we were returning to, nothing could truly prepare us for the months of disruption and "new normal" ahead. Little did I think I would still be working from home nearly 7 months later.
				</p>

				<p class="blogpost_body"> 
				It took me a few weeks to settle into working from home life. Step one was to set up my working area. I have a small desk in my bedroom, with my laptop wired to a second monitor, full-sized keyboard and mouse. 
				Due to the desk size and all my computer equipment, I don't have much space to write in my notebooks: I don't know about you, but I do prefer physical notetaking to virtual notetaking, especially if I want to do a quick sketch. 
				Lighting is not brilliant in my room, so I bought a cheap desk lamp which does a surprisingly good job. Step one complete. Step 2: sort a routine. I have tried to keep as close to my usual in-the-office routine as possible. 
				This has been easier said than done, there have been many distractions at home.
				</p>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Now, to my actual work. I count myself as extremely fortunate in the current circumstances. Since my PhD is based on computational data analysis (aka, sitting at my computer), it is only my working environment that has changed. 
				I access all my data and code via SSH links to remote computing facilities. In plain language, it is accessible online via a secure connection. Many of my friends and colleagues have not been so fortunate. 
				Researchers whose projects and/or placements are based on lab or field work have been left high and dry, leading some to suspend their research until the situation improves. 
				It’s only been in the past two months that access has been provided to labs and offices again, by application and with COVID measures in place of course.
				</p>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Whilst I <i>can</i> continue my research, it <i>hasn’t exactly</i> been plain sailing. Productivity has slowed considerably, and I do worry that I’m slipping further and further behind. One problem I’ve experienced is that my internet is not as fast or as stable as the University/NOCS network. 
				I really miss my office too, and the face-to-face interaction with others in my field. I miss the ability to ask anyone around me or in the building for help. Trying to explain my problems via email, or share screen on a video call, is less than ideal. The main computing facility I use also took the opportunity to do a major upgrade to the operating system: a change that has crippled the software I depend upon. 
				It’s taken nearly 3 weeks to repair it and I haven’t even fixed all of it yet! Many in my field have been hit with similar issues. The pandemic has however provided a small number of benefits. I’ve been able to “attend” more seminars since they have all gone online. 
				My university research group has finally started regular meetings, including a seminar and discussion series.
				</p>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				Currently I’m writing my first paper for (hopeful) publication, which is now in the advanced stages of preparation. I’m also preparing my Confirmation report and presentation. These tasks have taken significantly longer than I would have liked due to the problems mentioned earlier. 
				In other news, demonstrating has also started up again but in a new online format. Whilst I’m happy to be assisting with teaching once again, I do prefer teaching in person.
				</p>
				<p class="blogpost_body">
				That concludes this blog post. Congratulations if you made it to the end and, of course, thanks for reading! Until the next time...
