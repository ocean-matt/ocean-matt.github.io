				Cast your mind back to a time when things were normal -- the second weekend of March
				2020. A time before lockdowns and social distancing; when pubs still opened,
				international travel was easy and live sports were a thing. This story starts in a bar in
				Tenerife, where a group of scientists, sailors and technicians were enjoying the sun and
				relishing in the sporting prowess of the England rugby team, as they stormed to victory
				over the Welsh. We were enjoying our last taste of normal, for what we thought would be
				a short six weeks. The team was about to embark on a voyage of discovery across the
				Atlantic, solving some of the many mysteries of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
				Circulation (AMOC).</p>

				<p>
				The expedition was part of the RAPID project (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/">https://www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/</a>)
				which has been continuously monitoring the AMOC since 2004. The backbone of the
				project is the RAPID array of around 20 or so moorings. These are situated along the
				26.5N parallel, stretching from the Canary Islands in the East and Bahamas in the West.
				The moorings are concentrated off the West coast of Morocco, the mid-Atlantic ridge,
				and the East of the Bahamas. They're a real feat of engineering, with some more than 5
				km tall. Dotted along the length of the moorings’ anchor wires are MicroCAT (CTD)
				instruments measuring conductivity, temperature, and pressure, which with geostrophic
				balance can be used to estimate the strength of the ocean circulation. There’s also a
				host of more exotic instruments such as current meters, oxygen sensors, remote
				autonomous samplers and others.</p>

				Back to our story -- the crew had been tasked with recovering, servicing and redeploying
				these moorings. Within a day or so we were well on our way and getting stuck into the
				laborious process of hunting down and laying out moorings. Thankfully (for variety is the
				spice of life) there were more than just moorings to keep us occupied. Back in Tenerife
				we had been joined by scientists from NOAA who had entrusted us with a precious cargo
				-- a set of 12 glass spheres containing pressure inverted echo-sounders. These 'PIES', as
				they are affectionately known, may one day become ubiquitous in the global ocean
				monitoring system. It is hoped that they will be able to replicate some of the
				functionality of a mooring, but at a fraction of the cost. The PIES are lowered (read:
				lowered to the surface then dropped for a descent of several thousand metres) to the
				bottom of the ocean where they remain for a year, measuring the properties of the water
				column above them. When they're done measuring they then release their anchor and
				float up to the surface, beaming back their data to satellites. Though the system has
				undergone extensive testing, this is the first time they have been deployed in anger -- as
				their data comes in, it will be fascinating to see how successful their deployment has
				been!</p>

				<p>
				Having completed the servicing of the Eastern section of the array we embarked on a 4
				day steam to the mid-Atlantic ridge, with a brief pause to deploy an Argo float
				(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/">http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/</a>). 
				Around half way through the passage, a meeting of all the
				ships company was called. The ship had received a message informing us we were to
				turn around and steam back to Southampton. It must be said that this wasn't
				unexpected. When we left the Canaries, we were aware of the coronavirus and its
				increasingly rapid spread. It was strange at sea watching the situation unfold, being so
				very isolated from everything going on back at home. We saw first the toilet roll
				shortages, then, as the days went on, it became clear things were becoming serious and
				the virus was causing a huge amount of suffering. Within three days of the decision to
				turn back having been made, the UK went into lockdown -- it was clear heading home
				was the right decision.</p>
				
				<p>
				It was to be a long and slow steam back, but we were safe and there were still many other things to keep us occupied.....</p>
				
				<p>
				Our 10-day voyage to Southampton gave us ample time to complete our cruise report
				sections, as standard for all research cruises. We also had enough time to complete
				some more unusual tasks such as 3D mapping the ship, using a special 3D imaging
				camera kindly lent to us by colleagues at BAS. Whilst the mapping began back in
				Tenerife, the additional no-science days allowed us to complete the project. It was an
				amazing opportunity to enter areas that us scientists wouldn’t normally work in: crawling
				(literally) around the engine room, workshops and thruster room. It was also an
				opportunity to chat to the engineers who keep the ship running. We also managed to
				map one of the two lifeboats. The completed scans will be used in future public
				outreach activities.</p>

				<p>
				The return journey also gave the captain the perfect excuse to hold another muster and fire drill for the crew. Whilst the crew were busy extracting a simulated “casualty” from
				the engine room in full breathing apparatus and fire-proof suits, we were given the much less stressful task of “boundary cooling the fire” from the aft deck. In reality, this meant
				aiming the hoses overboard and seeing how far you could propel the water.</p>

				We may not be marine biologists, but we were delighted to see many dolphins keeping
				us company on our return journey, with a brief glimpse of a whale. Other non-science
				cruise highlights were the amazing sunsets we got almost each evening. It was a real
				treat to spend many an evening on the bridge and Forecastle Deck stargazing under the
				clearest skies we’re likely to come across. From conversations with the very friendly and
				knowledgeable bridge crew, we gained more insight into the operation of the ship too.
				Some of us also got steering lessons!</p>

				After 20 days at sea, on Saturday 28th March we arrived at the Port of Southampton and
				tied up alongside the National Oceanography Centre. All our equipment was put into
				cages and lifted onto the quayside. Of course this was all done with social distancing in
				mind, with quayside staff not allowed to come aboard to assist for fear of infecting us.
				Once the majority of this was done, all scientists and technicians signed off and went
				home to sit out the lockdown and discover what this “new normal” is all about. In some
				sense we were very lucky: many commercial seafarers are still stranded offshore with no
				end in sight to their ordeal. We had also been at sea for the panic buying stage of the
				pandemic and supermarket stock levels had mostly recovered! Despite our cruise being
				cut short, the 3 weeks we spent at sea certainly taught us a great deal about time series
				data collection and was a valuable experience. Of course, we would like to thank chief
				scientist Ben Moat for inviting us to come aboard, and to all scientists, tech and crew
				who made the cruise an enjoyable success.</p>
