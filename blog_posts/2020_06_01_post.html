				<!-- Post Content -->
				<p>
					Welcome to my blog! Yes, you heard that right. A blog. I never thought I'd ever say I've made a blog, but so I have. 
					Initially, I'm not going to be advertising this, so if you've stumbled across this post then congratulations!
				</p>

				<p> 
				I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm Matt, and I'm now a second year SPITFIRE-funded PhD student at the University of Southampton & National Oceanography Centre. 
				My PhD research focuses on quantifying the changing North Atlantic Ocean and its effects within European shelf seas.
				As time goes on, I'll share progress updates.
				</p>
				<p>
				Why start a blog now? In some ways, I wish I could have started one sooner. Not only to inform the public, but also to get it straight in my own head! As a publically-funded researcher, it's also essential that I broadcast my research output to a wide audience.
				Creating this blog and website has also given me an opportunity to do some extra coding practice. In my research, I use Python and Matlab to analyse all my data and produce outputs such as graphs. I thought learning a bit of HTML in my own time would be good. 
				So with this in mind, I've started this (highly experimental) blog. First things first, a PhD is not an easy thing. There are many twists and turns that lead down to dead ends or unexpected destinations.
				One thing I've learned is you almost never stick to your original plan! My plans and aims have changed, particulary as I've discovered new things. More on this later.
				</p>
				<p>
				This blog will follow my journey as a PhD student. There is bound to be posts of joy and posts of pure frustration. It will also feature some of my hiking highlights too! (not a suprise to anyone who knows me well.
				</p>
